I tried buying software last week and instead got a reminder on how to sell

Here’s what happened:

All 4 vendors had “Book a demo” as the only CTA

Only 1 had pricing on their website

2 no showed with zero follow up

1 cancelled an hour before -- the RSVP got cut off but basically said “$80K/year minimum”

1 was vibe coded in the last 4 months and might not even work

I get it: we’re a small team, not an enterprise logo, not your ICP

But ghosting isn’t a strategy to maximize ARR-- it’s just bad manners

SaaS is a long game: today’s “unqualified” lead is tomorrow’s buyer, champion or warm intro

If “Book a demo” is your CTA then please be there when someone shows up
