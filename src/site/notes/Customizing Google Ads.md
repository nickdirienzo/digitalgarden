TIL about https://myadcenter.google.com/customize

Specifically the "Sensitive" tab that lets users toggle off ads about:
* Alcohol
* Dating
* Gambling
* Pregnancy and parenting
* Weight loss

I've been seeing so many ads on YouTube these days that are just not great (they never have been). It's really not great listing to a DJ set and then have it interrupted by GLP-1 marketing. I'd prefer for it to not be interrupted at all, but creators gotta make money somehow, so I don't mind some ads.

At least, now I can hopefully have the peace of mind that these more egregious ads won't show up on my feed.

Hope this helps someone else, because I had no idea it was even possible to turn off certain ad topics.
