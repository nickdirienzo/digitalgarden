I'm currently building [Mirage Security](https://miragesecurity.ai) with my longtime friend [Ross Lazerowitz](https://rosslazer.com/).

Before Mirage, I was an early engineer at [Modern Health](https://www.modernhealth.com/) (5th hire, eventually Head of Foundations Engineering), spent four years at [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/), and interned twice at Google. 

 I studied computer science at the University at Buffalo, where I [published research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qwcFsGsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) on mobile privacy and co-founded [UB Hacking](https://ubhacking.com/), the school's annual hackathon.

This site is my [digital garden](https://nickdirienzo.com/digital-gardening/): a place to think out loud about building software,
working with AI, and the startup journey.

I'm moving away from social media, but you can still find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickdirienzo/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/nickdirienzo).[]()
