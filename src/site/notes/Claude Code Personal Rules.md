Since December 2025, I've been fully into `jj` (see [Working with jujutsu]).

Claude Code defaults to `git` and doesn't seem to have a good grasp of using `jj` as  a tool.

We've recently brought Claude Code back into reviewing PRs now that Opus 4.5 is effectively a mid-level engineer. 

While looking at the docs, I learned about [User-level Rules](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#user-level-rules). 

I had no idea about this despite using Claude Code daily for 6 months. 

More to come on my usage of Claude Code, but in the meantime, [a friend shared his use of Claude Code](https://www.geoffreychallen.com/talks/2026-01-15-a-day-with-claude-using-and-teaching-coding-agents) which is pretty similar to mine.
