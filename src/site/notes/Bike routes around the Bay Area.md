I started cycling in March 2025 with a new Specialized Sirrus X 2.0. While most of my day to day riding is commuting from Oakland to San Francisco, I've found some really great routes.

## East Bay
* Iron Horse Trail from Dublin BART to Walnut Creek BART: 16~ miles

## Sonoma County
* Sebastopol loop from Forestville: 16~ miles
